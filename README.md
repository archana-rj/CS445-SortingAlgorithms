# CS445: Sorting Algorithms Analysis

## Goal: 
Empirically verify relative efficiencies of QuickSort and its variations. This is done by timing each sort in different situations on different size arrays. Then, tabulate the results and compare the algorithms' performances. Ideally we want to see which base cases work best to optimize our various sorts and which version of QuickSort performs the best overall. For purposes of comparison we would also like to consider the MergeSort algorithm. These algorithms are compared via a solid object-oriented approach and in a formulaic way.

## Test 4 sorting algorithms:
1) Simple Quicksort with A[last] as the pivot
2) Median of 3 Quicksort
3) Random Pivot Quicksort
4) MergeSort
